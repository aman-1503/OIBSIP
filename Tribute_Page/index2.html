          <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, an Indian aeronautical scientist who presided over India as its eleventh president from 2002 to 2007, was born on October 15, 1931, and passed away on July 27, 2015. He studied aeronautical engineering and physics and was born and reared in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu. He worked as a scientist and science administrator for the following four decades, primarily at the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) and the Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO). He was heavily involved in both India's efforts to develop military missiles and its civilian space programme. [1] As a result of his contributions to the advancement of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology, he earned the moniker "Missile Man of India." [2] [3] [4]
             He also played a pivotal organisational,
            technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in
            1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.
